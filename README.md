# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression-Techniques

This project was done for my Data Analysis in R (Python for the final project was allowed for whatever reason).

I worked on this project on my own. Data was sourced via this link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.
The entire project is outlined in the first section which is a general overview/summary of what was done during the project.
